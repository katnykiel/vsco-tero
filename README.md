# zotero-markdown

an unholy blend of vscode and zotero for literature review

## idea
 
- input: a paper in the browser you want to read
- use zotero to download pdfs and metadata from scholar/wherever
- use zotfile to rename PDF
- read PDFs either in zotero, vscode, or other pdf viewer
- export .bib file with zotero
- make literature note from .bib file
    - item metadata
    - automatic tagging
    - gpt-generated insight
    - users can add their own article notes to md file
- annotations in zotero
    - highlight in zotero
    - export annotations to markdown
    - add annotations to literature note
- output: web of .md files each corresponding to a paper and containing metadata and info
