abstract: This paper offers an in-depth examination of the intellectual virtue of
  inquisitiveness. A characterization of inquisitiveness is developed in Part I in
  which the inquisitive person is identified as one who is characteristically motivated
  to engage sincerely in good questioning. Part II then examines the place of inquisitiveness
  among the virtues. Inquisitiveness is seen to bear a defining relationship to the
  process of inquiry as a fundamentally motivating intellectual virtue. On this basis,
  it is argued that inquisitiveness plays a distinctively valuable role in the intellectually
  virtuous life placing it at the heart of autonomous virtue epistemology.
