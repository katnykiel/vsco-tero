abstract: "The author outlines a radically different decision-making model form the\
  \ one widely used in Economics and in Psychology. Accordingly, most choices are\
  \ made on the basis of emotional involvements and value commitments. Information\
  \ processing is often excluded. In other areas of choices, emotions and values allow\
  \ for some subsets of options to be rationally considered but \u2018color\u2019\
  \ them and/or short cut the deliberations. In a still other subset emotion/values\
  \ require rational decision-making. Emotions and values are not necessarily disruptive;\
  \ they have positive functions. Cognitivists' objections to the concept of emotions\
  \ are responded to. Problems of operationalization are raised. The question, if\
  \ the concepts of emotions and values can be incorporated into the neoclassical\
  \ paradigm, is explored."
