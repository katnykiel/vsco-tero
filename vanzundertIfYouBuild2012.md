abstract: Programs aiming to develop large scale digital infrastructure for the humanities
  motivate this development mostly by the wish to leverage methodological innovation
  through digital and computational approaches. It is questionable, however, if large
  scale infrastructures are the right incubator model for bringing about such innovation.
  The necessary generalizations and standardizations, management and development processes
  that large infrastructures need to apply to cater to wholesale humanities are at
  odds with well-known aspects of innovation. Moreover, such generalizations close
  off many possibilities for exploring new modeling and computing approaches. I argue
  that methodological innovation and advancing the modeling of humanities data and
  heuristics is better served by flexible small-scale research focused development
  practices. It will also be shown that modeling highly specific distributed web services
  is a more promising avenue for sustainability of highly heterogeneous humanities
  digital data than standards enforcement and current encoding practices.
