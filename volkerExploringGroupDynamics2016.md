abstract: Deliberative monetary valuation has emerged as a promising alternative to
  conventional stated preference studies of ecosystem services. It promises to give
  respondents a better basis for decision-making by exposing them to a more diverse
  set of knowledge, arguments and opinions through group discussion. However, under
  certain conditions, small groups may fail to effectively pool the individual knowledge
  of their members. This paper examines the impact of the initial distribution of
  individual preferences in discussion groups on the outcome of deliberative choice
  experiments. Drawing on a deliberative monetary valuation study of forest ecosystem
  services in West Saxony, Germany, it is shown that the initial preference distribution
  in groups influences both the diversity of arguments exchanged during group discussions
  and respondents' consideration of the costs of environmental policies. Furthermore,
  results indicate that respondents' post-discussion willingness-to-pay is affected
  by the initial preference distribution in groups, though these changes were not
  statistically significant. The choice certainty of respondents was found to remain
  largely unaffected. Overall, the empirical findings of this study provide preliminary
  evidence about the need to conduct future deliberative monetary valuation studies
  with groups with heterogeneous initial preferences as this may provide respondents
  with a more complete set of decision-relevant information.
